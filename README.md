VbaAddin
========

Please note that you will need to alter the references to the NetOffice dlls.  

You can download these from http://netoffice.codeplex.com/

This is a basic demonstration of a VBA addin based on the MZ-tools article:
http://www.mztools.com/articles/2012/MZ2012013.aspx

Modifications are to use NetOffice Interop assemblies instead of creating private ones.  Note
that this project loads as an addin but causes an exception when trying to press one of the
menu buttons.
